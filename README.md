## Project 1 - Predicting Diamond Prices
A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid, the companyâ€™s analytics team used a large database of diamond prices to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. In this project,the model is applied to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid for the entire set of 3,000 diamonds.
